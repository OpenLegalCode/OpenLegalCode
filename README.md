OpenLegalCode
=============

Initiative of interested governments to establish a light weight common approach to publishing legislation and laws of their jurisdictions as open data, accessible in human and machine readable formats, available at a public API and as batch files. 

As of May 4th, 2014 the Cities of New York, San Francisco and Washingron DC are engaged in the OpenLegalCode initiative.  The initiative also benefits from participation by Foundations, namely the OpenGov Foundation and Sunlight Foundation, which provide important advice, feedback and ideas.  

Please pose questions about this initiative and inquiries about participation by more (ultimately all) governments of the United States, whether local, state or federal agencies through our web form at [OpenLegalCode.net](http://openlegalcode.net). 

The initiative is convened and initially facilitated by the MIT Media Lab's Legal Science Research Team (eCitizen.MIT.edu and LegalScience.TV) with the hope and intention that when validated and organized the participating governments will establish a governance and project oversight plan enabling MIT to effectively hand-off this OpenLegalCode GitHub organization and repositries, the OpenLegalCode domain name and webfiles and any other relevant project files or other assets.
